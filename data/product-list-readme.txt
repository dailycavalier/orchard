How to convert spreadsheet into website data format.

1. Save the sheet as a CSV file (File->Save As->CSV)
2. Open the CSV file in a code editor and change line endings to Unix (View->Line Endings->Unix)
3. Change the first row header from ALLCAPS to Title Case (Highlight the row, File->Convert Case->Title Case)
4. Remove all double-double quotes ("") (File->Replace "")
5. Change capitalization for Category and Sold By columns (each of these needs to be done manually)
