          <p>The groundwork for Wood’s Produce Company was laid in the mid-1970s when Mark Wood moved to Meadows of Dan, VA and found a job growing, packing, and delivering fresh cabbage for a family farm called Terry’s Produce.  Working with the Terry family ingrained Mark with the core values of hard work, integrity, and dedication to the customer that Wood’s Produce Company has been built on from Day 1.</p>
          
          <p>When the Terry family decided to stop growing produce in 1987, Mark decided the best way to provide for his wife Carol and soon to be born sons, Jonathon &amp; Marcus was to carry on the produce business.  Mark bought Terry’s Produce, changed the name to Wood’s Produce Company, and drove to Winston-Salem the next morning armed with only a pickup truck and $200.  He bought all the produce he could afford, and then stopped at businesses along his way home, selling out of produce by the time he got home.</p>
          
          <p>Day after day, Mark worked tirelessly to take care of his customers better than anyone else could.  Within 12 years, Mark and Carol had built a $5 million dollar per year from scratch working out of a 3,000-square foot cabbage packing shed turned produce warehouse.</p>
          
          <p>In 2000, Wood’s Produce Company moved to its current location and has been thriving ever since while remaining a true family business.  After graduating from the University of Virginia, Jonathon came back to join the family business.  In 2012, we recently completed construction on a new 8,800-square-foot, state-of-the-art cooler facility.</p>
          
          <p>In an ever-changing produce industry, Wood’s Produce Company has been successful by staying true to our principles of hard work, integrity, delivering the highest quality produce, and making customer satisfaction our top priority.</p>
